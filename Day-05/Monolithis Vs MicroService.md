✅ Monolithic Architecture -> agar js use kiya to pura js me likhana pdta

In monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as one single unit.

All modules (UI, business logic, database layer, authentication, etc.) are tightly coupled and run in a single codebase and single deployment.

If even a small change is made, the whole application has to be redeployed.

Mostly suitable for small to medium applications.

Advantages:

Simple development and deployment.

Easy debugging and testing because everything is in one place.

Disadvantages:

Not scalable module-wise (must scale the whole application).

Tight coupling → one failure can crash the whole system.

Slow development as the app grows and becomes complex.

✅ Microservices Architecture -> backend kisi bhi language me likhskta sb independant alag team banaka kam kro mst

Microservices architecture breaks the application into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific function (e.g., User Service, Payment Service, Cart Service).

Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Communication happens through APIs, like REST or gRPC.

Advantages:

Highly scalable (scale only the required service).

Independent deployment → faster updates.

Fault isolation → failure in one service doesn’t crash the entire system.

Allows use of different programming languages and databases for different services.

Disadvantages:

More complex to manage due to distributed services.

Requires DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).

Difficult debugging across multiple services.
