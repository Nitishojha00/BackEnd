ðŸ§¾ Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured Databases

why images and videos are not stored in structured DBMS

ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction

In modern data systems, data can exist in different formats depending on how it is organized and stored.

Based on organization, data is categorized into:

Structured Data

Semi-Structured Data

Unstructured Data

Each category requires different types of storage systems and database management techniques.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Structured Data
âž¤ Definition:

Structured data refers to data that is organized in fixed fields and formats, usually stored in tables with rows and columns in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

âž¤ Examples:

Student records (Roll No, Name, Marks)

Bank transactions

Employee databases

SQL tables in MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL

âž¤ Characteristics:

Fixed Schema: Every record follows the same structure.

Data Type Defined: Each column has a defined data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE).

Easily Searchable: Can be queried using SQL (Structured Query Language).

High Consistency: Data integrity is maintained using keys and constraints.

Storage System: Stored in RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server.

âž¤ Example Table:
Roll_No	Name	Branch	Marks
101	Nitish	CSE	85
102	Yogesh	ME	75
âž¤ Use Case:

Used where data is well-defined and relationships are important â€” e.g., banking, inventory, payroll.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Semi-Structured Data
âž¤ Definition:

Semi-structured data does not follow a fixed schema but still has some structure using tags or markers to separate data elements.

âž¤ Examples:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

XML (Extensible Markup Language)

CSV files, NoSQL databases (like MongoDB)

âž¤ Characteristics:

Flexible Schema: Different records may have different fields.

Uses Tags or Key-Value Pairs: Example â€“ JSON or XML tags identify data items.

Partially Structured: Some structure exists, but not as rigid as SQL tables.

Easily Adaptable: Schema can change without affecting other records.

Storage System: Stored in NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB).

âž¤ Example (JSON Format):
{
  "name": "Nitish",
  "age": 22,
  "skills": ["C++", "Python", "Node.js"]
}

âž¤ Use Case:

Used in web APIs, IoT, document storage, and big data systems where flexibility is required.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Unstructured Data
âž¤ Definition:

Unstructured data has no predefined format or structure. It cannot be stored in traditional rows and columns.

âž¤ Examples:

Images, Videos, Audio Files

Emails, Word Documents, PDFs

Social media posts, chats, or logs

Surveillance footage, scanned documents

âž¤ Characteristics:

No Fixed Schema: Data does not follow a defined model.

Difficult to Search or Query: Cannot use SQL directly to query.

Large in Size: Often involves multimedia and consumes more storage.

Requires Special Storage Systems: Stored in object storage or NoSQL systems.

Processed Using AI/ML or Big Data Tools: For example, using Hadoop, Spark, or TensorFlow.

âž¤ Example:

A video lecture file (lecture1.mp4) or image (student_photo.jpg) â€” cannot be represented in table rows/columns.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Why Images and Videos Are Not Stored in Structured DBMS
âž¤ (i) Fixed Schema Limitation

Structured DBMS like MySQL require data in numeric or textual form.

Multimedia data (images, audio, video) doesnâ€™t fit into rows and columns.

âž¤ (ii) Large File Size

Images and videos are very large in size (MBs or GBs).

Storing such large binary data directly in DBMS leads to performance issues and slow retrieval.

âž¤ (iii) Complex Data Type

DBMS tables use data types like INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.

Multimedia data requires Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) â€” which increase storage overhead.

âž¤ (iv) Slower Performance

Storing and retrieving multimedia data inside DBMS reduces speed and efficiency.

File systems handle large binary files faster than relational databases.

âž¤ (v) Better Alternatives Exist

Instead of storing media in DBMS, developers store:

File path (URL or location) in the database

Actual image/video file in a file system or cloud storage (like AWS S3, Google Drive, etc.)

âž¤ Example:
ID	Name	Image_Path
1	Nitish	/uploads/nitish.jpg
2	Riya	/uploads/riya.png

â†’ Only the path is stored in the database, while the image itself is saved separately.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Summary Table
Type	Structure	Schema	Example Data	Storage Type
Structured	Tabular (Rows & Columns)	Fixed	Student table, Salary record	RDBMS (MySQL, Oracle)
Semi-Structured	Tag-based / Key-Value	Flexible	JSON, XML, CSV	NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra)
Unstructured	Free-form, binary	None	Images, Videos, Audio	File system, Object Storage
ðŸ”¹ 7. Conclusion

Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured data differ in their organization, storage, and accessibility.
Structured data fits perfectly in RDBMS because of its fixed schema.
Semi-structured data fits in NoSQL databases, which provide flexibility.
Unstructured data, such as images and videos, cannot be efficiently stored in a structured DBMS because of their large size, non-tabular nature, and performance limitations.
Hence, such multimedia files are usually stored in file systems or specialized storage services, while the database stores only metadata or file paths.

âœ… Final Short Summary:
| Structured â†’ SQL tables (Fixed Schema)
| Semi-Structured â†’ JSON/XML (Flexible Schema)
| Unstructured â†’ Images/Videos/Text (No Schema)
