💡 Why We Can’t Apply Binary Search Directly on an Array of Objects

Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm (O(log n)) that works by dividing a sorted dataset in half repeatedly until the key is found.
But this algorithm depends heavily on fixed-size, directly comparable data — which objects do not provide.

🔹 1. Binary Search Assumes Fixed-Size, Comparable Elements
➤ Concept:

Binary search works best on contiguous, fixed-size data like numbers or strings.

The algorithm calculates the middle index and jumps directly to it using random access in memory.

👉 For example:

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
mid = (0 + 4)/2 → index 2 → value 30


All values are fixed-size (integers) and comparable → binary search works perfectly.

🔹 2. Objects Are Variable-Sized Data Structures
➤ Key Issue:

Each object can contain:

Different number of keys

Different data types

Nested arrays or sub-objects

Hence, each object may occupy different memory sizes.

let arr = [
  {id: 1, name: "Nitish"},
  {id: 2, name: "Yogesh", marks: [90, 85, 80]},
  {id: 3, address: {city: "Lucknow"}}
];


Here:

1st object has 2 keys

2nd object has 3 keys

3rd object has nested objects

So, the size in memory is not constant.

🔹 3. Why Fixed Size Matters for Binary Search (Low-Level View)
➤ Internally:

In low-level languages (like C/C++), binary search can jump to the middle using:

mid_address = base_address + (mid * element_size);


👉 This calculation only works if element_size is constant.

➤ But for Objects:

Objects in JS (or in general) are reference types, stored on the heap.

Each object reference in the array just points to some variable-sized data block in memory.

Hence, even if we calculate the “middle index”, the actual data’s location may vary in memory and has no relation to size or order.

So, you can’t perform direct positional access based on size — which binary search needs.

🔹 4. No Defined Comparison Between Objects

Even if we somehow locate the middle object:

if (arr[mid] === key) // ❌ invalid comparison


This fails because:

JS cannot compare two entire objects by value.

Only references are compared — and they’ll never match unless it’s the same object in memory.

✅ You must specify a key property (like .id) to compare.

🔹 5. So, Two Main Barriers Exist:
Reason	Explanation
1️⃣ Variable Object Size	Objects occupy different amounts of memory; binary search assumes fixed-size elements for predictable indexing.
2️⃣ No Natural Comparison Rule	Objects cannot be compared directly using <, >, or ===; binary search relies on ordered, comparable data.
🔹 6. How to Make It Work Anyway

To apply binary search on an array of objects:

Sort the array based on a property (e.g. id).

Compare using that property (not the whole object).

Ignore memory layout — JS handles reference memory internally.

✅ Example:

function binarySearch(arr, key) {
  let left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (arr[mid].id === key) return mid;
    else if (arr[mid].id < key) left = mid + 1;
    else right = mid - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}

🔹 7. Summary
Aspect	Primitive Array (Works)	Array of Objects (Fails)
Fixed Size	✅ All elements equal size	❌ Each object can vary
Direct Comparison	✅ <, > works	❌ Needs key like .id
Memory Access	✅ Sequential, predictable	❌ Reference-based, variable
Sorting	✅ Natural order exists	❌ Must define comparison rule

✅ Final Conclusion:

We can’t apply binary search directly on an array of objects because objects:

Have no fixed size (memory varies per object),

Are stored by reference (not by value),

And lack a direct comparison operator.

Binary search only works on sorted, fixed-size, directly comparable datasets

Also binary search requires a comparable, ordered dataset, but objects are unordered reference types.

We can only apply binary search if we sort the array based on a specific key and compare using that key.
