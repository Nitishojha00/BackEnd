✅ Express.js — Short Note

    Express.js is a fast, lightweight, and flexible web application framework for Node.js.

    It is used to build web servers and RESTful APIs easily.

    Works on top of the Node.js HTTP module, providing simplified routing, middleware support, and request/response handling.

    Follows middleware architecture, where each request passes through functions (middlewares) before reaching the final response.

    Supports routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to handle different endpoints.

    Can integrate easily with databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

    Provides built-in support for JSON, cookies, static files, and form data.

    Widely used in MERN stack for backend development.
